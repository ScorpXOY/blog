Hi! I'm **Borja Requena**, currently doing my PhD at [ICFO](http://icfo.eu/) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Maciej Lewenstein and Prof. Dr. Ferran Mazzanti.

Here you will find finished projects (illustrative TL;DR versions), some things that I am currently developing, teaching content and, certainly, random testing about things I am trying to learn. 

You may expect a mixture of machine learning and quantum physics.
